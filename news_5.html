<p>New this week in <a href="https://www.battlehouse.com/play/firestrike">Firestrike</a>:</p>



<h2>Tactical Ops Center Level 19</h2>



<p>Your architects have been hard at work, Commander. In addition to a sharply-worded requisition order for more coffee, they’ve delivered the upgrade plans for the next Tactical Ops Center expansion.</p>



<p><strong>Effective today:</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>Tactical Ops Center</strong> level cap is raised to <strong>Level 19</strong>, paving the way for <strong>new maximum levels for all buildings, turrets, landmines, and top-tier units.</strong></p>



<p>Like what you see, or have more awesome feedback to share? Let us know over in the &#8220;firestrike&#8221; channel within our TR Discord Server.</p>



<p>Good hunting, Firestrikers!</p>

<p>New this week in <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/thunderrun?spin_campaign=7125_BH_post">Thunder Run</a>:</p>



<h2>Level 13 Tactical Ops Center</h2>



<p>Your architects have been hard at work, Commander. In addition to a sharply-worded requisition order for more coffee, they’ve delivered the upgrade plans for the next <strong>Tactical Ops Center</strong> expansion. It seems like only yesterday we were huddled together in tents.</p>



<p><strong>Tick-Tock! The TOC now upgrades to Level 13</strong>, unlocking a variety of new upgrades for your military forces!</p>



<p>We’ll be sure to caffeinate your architects for you, Commander. That requisition order was just shy of a death threat.</p>



<h2>The Elephant in the Room</h2>



<p>As you all have noticed, there has been a lot of changes happening since last week. We do apologize for the delay in our communications, but we&#8217;d now like to address and explain what, why, and how things have changed. </p>



<p>Hopefully, in addition to dispelling some weird rumors and theories, we can clear the air and give you a little more insight as to how to utilize the new systems put in place. For simplicity&#8217;s sake we will categorize the main changes into two: <em>economy and buildings, </em>and<em> unit rebalance and strategy</em>.</p>



<h2>Economy and Buildings</h2>



<ul><li>Previously, levels per tier are wildly inconsistent. They are now consistent</li><li>Economy buildings now have two levels per tier.</li><li>All unit research/production buildings have two levels per tier.</li><li>Non-elite units and their associated research/production buildings also get two levels per tier.</li><li>Turrets, mines, and missiles have three levels per tier.</li><li>Time requirements dramatically reduced. It takes a maximum of 5 days (without leader bonuses) to build or research anything now. It&#8217;s a hard cap at 120 hours.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Frequently asked question</strong>: <em>Why are our resource storage and production so low now?</em><br>Our old levels jumped all over the place in terms of advancement. Now they&#8217;re consistent. However, all research unlocks, build costs, repair costs, etc are now auto-scaled to the available harvest rate and storage caps, so <strong>you have lost absolutely nothing in terms of buying power</strong>. Think of it this way: <strong>your resource currency just underwent serious deflation</strong>. You can buy more with each unit of each resource than you could before.</p>



<h2>Unit Rebalance and Strategy</h2>



<ul><li>Unit HP, DPS, build time, and resource costs all balanced <strong>based on space requirements</strong>. The more expensive a unit, the more powerful it is, and at a predictable and consistent rate. That means that out the gate, <strong>a unit that takes 30 space is exactly twice as powerful as a unit of the same type that takes 15 space</strong>, but they receive modifications based on their roles.</li><li>Unit speed and range balanced based on unit type and unit role: <strong>Infantry </strong>is the slowest with the longest range on average. <strong>Air units</strong> are the fastest with the shortest range on average. <strong>Artillery </strong>and <strong>Sniper </strong>units get range boosts and speed nerfs to compensate</li><li>Close range units get a bonus to their speed and a proportionate nerf to their range.</li><li>Long Range units get the same bonus to range and nerf to speed.</li><li>High Speed gets a slightly higher boost to speed while paying the same range cost as close range.</li><li>DPS units get a bonus to damage and a proportionate nerf to HP. Most of your artillery units are Long Range/DPS roles.</li><li>Some units have the &#8220;<strong>Threat</strong>&#8221; stat, which makes the AI increase their priority in the targeting system by 50%.</li><li><strong>Threat </strong>gets a bonus to HP and a nerf to damage.</li><li>The &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role get a bonus to HP and get an even higher &#8220;<strong>Threat</strong>&#8221; stat, making the AI 100% more likely to pick them as a target. Note that the &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role is <strong>not strictly limited to actual Tank units.</strong> Some aircrafts have the &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role, too. You can find these in the Unlock/Upgrade windows of a specific unit.</li><li>Turret HP is based on potential attacker DPS output, and is currently designed to withstand 20 seconds of fire from the average unit. There will be ongoing analysis and fine-tuning for this.</li><li>Mine DPS is designed to insta-kill the strongest non-elite unit in its target category.</li><li>Turret DPS is designed to focus on particular target types as well and to kill a target in 2 to 10 seconds of sustained fire.</li><li>Missile DPS is designed to take a few hits to kill the toughest units, while able to insta-kill groups of weaker ones.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Frequently asked question:</strong> <em>Why are units so weak now that we can&#8217;t do event bases anymore?</em><br>Units have been balanced to <strong>encourage trying different battalion compositions and being more strategic</strong>; possibly requiring a little more micro skills too. The <strong>older strategies</strong> of steam-rolling everything with Elite Paladins, for example, may no longer work, as they are now in an <strong>Artillery Role</strong>. It may be <strong>MORE </strong>effective to bring units with a <strong>Tank </strong>role and high <strong>Threat </strong>to draw aggro from turrets, then using <strong>Artillery </strong>like <strong>Mortarmen</strong>, due to their high anti-building DPS and very long range.</p>



<p>We know some players have taken up the new challenge of getting to know the new systems. Of course, we still welcome feedback. Please expect more monitoring and tweaking of the new systems, so if you have tried different strategies and still find it difficult, please let us know what you are having trouble with!</p>



<h2>Miscellaneous improvements and fixes</h2>



<ul><li>All costs (buildings, units) have been further reduced.</li><li>Vault protection is now 7.5% of supply/fuel storage available at the current tier, and 10% of hardware storage.</li><li>All upgrades, unit construction, missile, mine, and turret crafting should be appropriately scaled to resource storage. </li><li>Building HP should all be scaled to unit DPS. Turret, mine, and missile DPS should all be scaled to unit HP.</li><li>Special &#8220;items&#8221; added in the game that allows for insta-building missiles, or building &#8220;Doped&#8221; Mines that insta-kill any unit below its level. These items are obtainable from event bases, and sometimes, from the mail.</li><li>TOC leaders no longer have an equip/unequip cooldown</li><li>The update caused old missiles to unstack with no way to stack them. This has been fixed, but you may need to click the &#8220;Sort&#8221; button to restack your old missiles.</li><li>Issues with missile blueprints not unlocking the the research is being looked in to. Please do not repurchase the blueprints if you encounter this issue.</li><li>AI units all given some unique aspects. Hunt them all!</li></ul>



<p>More releases incoming, including a planned &#8220;grand finale&#8221; event. We here at Battlehouse are eternally grateful to all our players, and we plan to go out with a bang on April 2023; and we would <strong>love</strong> it if you join us there!</p>

<p>Good hunting, Commanders!</p>

They are now consistent</li><li>Economy buildings now have two levels per tier.</li><li>All unit research/production buildings have two levels per tier.</li><li>Non-elite units and their associated research/production buildings also get two levels per tier.</li><li>Turrets, mines, and missiles have three levels per tier.</li><li>Time requirements dramatically reduced. It takes a maximum of 5 days (without leader bonuses) to build or research anything now. It&#8217;s a hard cap at 120 hours.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Frequently asked question</strong>: <em>Why are our resource storage and production so low now?</em><br>Our old levels jumped all over the place in terms of advancement. Now they&#8217;re consistent. However, all research unlocks, build costs, repair costs, etc are now auto-scaled to the available harvest rate and storage caps, so <strong>you have lost absolutely nothing in terms of buying power</strong>. Think of it this way: <strong>your resource currency just underwent serious deflation</strong>. You can buy more with each unit of each resource than you could before.</p>



<h2>Unit Rebalance and Strategy</h2>



<ul><li>Unit HP, DPS, build time, and resource costs all balanced <strong>based on space requirements</strong>. The more expensive a unit, the more powerful it is, and at a predictable and consistent rate. That means that out the gate, <strong>a unit that takes 30 space is exactly twice as powerful as a unit of the same type that takes 15 space</strong>, but they receive modifications based on their roles.</li><li>Unit speed and range balanced based on unit type and unit role: <strong>Infantry </strong>is the slowest with the longest range on average. <strong>Air units</strong> are the fastest with the shortest range on average. <strong>Artillery </strong>and <strong>Sniper </strong>units get range boosts and speed nerfs to compensate</li><li>Close range units get a bonus to their speed and a proportionate nerf to their range.</li><li>Long Range units get the same bonus to range and nerf to speed.</li><li>High Speed gets a slightly higher boost to speed while paying the same range cost as close range.</li><li>DPS units get a bonus to damage and a proportionate nerf to HP. Most of your artillery units are Long Range/DPS roles.</li><li>Some units have the &#8220;<strong>Threat</strong>&#8221; stat, which makes the AI increase their priority in the targeting system by 50%.</li><li><strong>Threat </strong>gets a bonus to HP and a nerf to damage.</li><li>The &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role get a bonus to HP and get an even higher &#8220;<strong>Threat</strong>&#8221; stat, making the AI 100% more likely to pick them as a target. Note that the &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role is <strong>not strictly limited to actual Tank units.</strong> Some aircrafts have the &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role, too. You can find these in the Unlock/Upgrade windows of a specific unit.</li><li>Turret HP is based on potential attacker DPS output, and is currently designed to withstand 20 seconds of fire from the average unit. There will be ongoing analysis and fine-tuning for this.</li><li>Mine DPS is designed to insta-kill the strongest non-elite unit in its target category.</li><li>Turret DPS is designed to focus on particular target types as well and to kill a target in 2 to 10 seconds of sustained fire.</li><li>Missile DPS is designed to take a few hits to kill the toughest units, while able to insta-kill groups of weaker ones.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Frequently asked question:</strong> <em>Why are units so weak now that we can&#8217;t do event bases anymore?</em><br>Units have been balanced to <strong>encourage trying different battalion compositions and being more strategic</strong>; possibly requiring a little more micro skills too. The <strong>older strategies</strong> of steam-rolling everything with Elite Paladins, for example, may no longer work, as they are now in an <strong>Artillery Role</strong>. It may be <strong>MORE </strong>effective to bring units with a <strong>Tank </strong>role and high <strong>Threat </strong>to draw aggro from turrets, then using <strong>Artillery </strong>like <strong>Mortarmen</strong>, due to their high anti-building DPS and very long range.</p>



<p>We know some players have taken up the new challenge of getting to know the new systems. Of course, we still welcome feedback. Please expect more monitoring and tweaking of the new systems, so if you have tried different strategies and still find it difficult, please let us know what you are having trouble with!</p>



<h2>Miscellaneous improvements and fixes</h2>



<ul><li>Central Computer resource cost cuts are in. L4 to L11 (and eventually 12 and 13) now costs 55% of your maximum possible resources to build.</li><li>Major cuts to unit research costs and build costs are complete. </li><li>More buildings have had their hit points adjusted to unit DPS, and more building costs have been made proportionate to storage available at their CC level.</li><li>All upgrades, unit construction, missile, mine, and turret crafting should be appropriately scaled to resource storage. </li><li>Building HP should all be scaled to unit DPS. </li><li>AI units all given some unique aspects. Hunt them all!</li></ul>

<p>New this week in <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/warstarempire?spin_campaign=7125_BH_post">War Star Empire</a>:</p>



<h2>Central Computer Level 12</h2>



<p>Attention, Commanders!</p>



<p>Get ready to celebrate on Mars with this week&#8217;s update! <strong>Effective today:</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>Central Computer</strong> level cap is raised to <strong>Level 12</strong>, paving the way for new maximum levels for your <strong>production</strong>, <strong>storage</strong>, and <strong>research buildings</strong>!</p>



<h2>The Elephant in the Room</h2>



<p>As you all have noticed, there has been a lot of changes happening since last week. We do apologize for the delay in our communications, but we&#8217;d now like to address and explain what, why, and how things have changed. </p>



<p>Hopefully, in addition to dispelling some weird rumors and theories, we can clear the air and give you a little more insight as to how to utilize the new systems put in place. For simplicity&#8217;s sake we will categorize the main changes into two: <em>economy and buildings, </em>and<em> unit rebalance and strategy</em>.</p>



<h2>Economy and Buildings</h2>



<ul><li>Previously, levels per tier are wildly inconsistent. They are now consistent</li><li>Economy buildings now have two levels per tier.</li><li>All unit research/production buildings have two levels per tier.</li><li>Non-elite units and their associated research/production buildings also get two levels per tier.</li><li>Turrets, mines, and missiles have three levels per tier.</li><li>Time requirements dramatically reduced. It takes a maximum of 5 days (without leader bonuses) to build or research anything now. It&#8217;s a hard cap at 120 hours.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Frequently asked question</strong>: <em>Why are our resource storage and production so low now?</em><br>Our old levels jumped all over the place in terms of advancement. Now they&#8217;re consistent. However, all research unlocks, build costs, repair costs, etc are now auto-scaled to the available harvest rate and storage caps, so <strong>you have lost absolutely nothing in terms of buying power</strong>. Think of it this way: <strong>your resource currency just underwent serious deflation</strong>. You can buy more with each unit of each resource than you could before.</p>



<h2>Unit Rebalance and Strategy</h2>



<ul><li>Unit HP, DPS, build time, and resource costs all balanced <strong>based on space requirements</strong>. The more expensive a unit, the more powerful it is, and at a predictable and consistent rate. That means that out the gate, <strong>a unit that takes 30 space is exactly twice as powerful as a unit of the same type that takes 15 space</strong>, but they receive modifications based on their roles.</li><li>Unit speed and range balanced based on unit type and unit role: <strong>Infantry </strong>is the slowest with the longest range on average. <strong>Air units</strong> are the fastest with the shortest range on average. <strong>Artillery </strong>and <strong>Sniper </strong>units get range boosts and speed nerfs to compensate</li><li>Close range units get a bonus to their speed and a proportionate nerf to their range.</li><li>Long Range units get the same bonus to range and nerf to speed.</li><li>High Speed gets a slightly higher boost to speed while paying the same range cost as close range.</li><li>DPS units get a bonus to damage and a proportionate nerf to HP. Most of your artillery units are Long Range/DPS roles.</li><li>Some units have the &#8220;<strong>Threat</strong>&#8221; stat, which makes the AI increase their priority in the targeting system by 50%.</li><li><strong>Threat </strong>gets a bonus to HP and a nerf to damage.</li><li>The &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role get a bonus to HP and get an even higher &#8220;<strong>Threat</strong>&#8221; stat, making the AI 100% more likely to pick them as a target. Note that the &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role is <strong>not strictly limited to actual Tank units.</strong> Some aircrafts have the &#8220;<strong>Tank</strong>&#8221; role, too. You can find these in the Unlock/Upgrade windows of a specific unit.</li><li>Turret HP is based on potential attacker DPS output, and is currently designed to withstand 20 seconds of fire from the average unit. There will be ongoing analysis and fine-tuning for this.</li><li>Mine DPS is designed to insta-kill the strongest non-elite unit in its target category.</li><li>Turret DPS is designed to focus on particular target types as well and to kill a target in 2 to 10 seconds of sustained fire.</li><li>Missile DPS is designed to take a few hits to kill the toughest units, while able to insta-kill groups of weaker ones.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Frequently asked question:</strong> <em>Why are units so weak now that we can&#8217;t do event bases anymore?</em><br>Units have been balanced to <strong>encourage trying different battalion compositions and being more strategic</strong>; possibly requiring a little more micro skills too. The <strong>older strategies</strong> of steam-rolling everything with Elite Paladins, for example, may no longer work, as they are now in an <strong>Artillery Role</strong>. It may be <strong>MORE </strong>effective to bring units with a <strong>Tank </strong>role and high <strong>Threat </strong>to draw aggro from turrets, then using <strong>Artillery </strong>like <strong>Mortarmen</strong>, due to their high anti-building DPS and very long range.</p>

Please expect more monitoring and tweaking of the new systems, so if you have tried different strategies and still find it difficult, please let us know what you are having trouble with!</p>



<h2>Miscellaneous improvements and fixes</h2>



<ul><li>Central Computer resource cost cuts are in. L4 to L11 (and eventually 12 and 13) now costs 65% of your maximum possible resources to build.</li><li>Major cuts to unit research costs and build costs are complete. </li><li>More buildings have had their hit points adjusted to unit DPS, and more building costs have been made proportionate to storage available at their CC level.</li><li>All upgrades, unit construction, missile, mine, and turret crafting should be appropriately scaled to resource storage. </li><li>Building HP should all be scaled to unit DPS. Turret, mine, and missile DPS should all be scaled to unit HP.</li><li>Special &#8220;items&#8221; added in the game that allows for insta-building missiles, or building &#8220;Doped&#8221; Mines that insta-kill any unit below its level. These items are obtainable from event bases, and sometimes, from the mail.</li><li>CC leaders no longer have an equip/unequip cooldown</li><li>The update caused old missiles to unstack with no way to stack them. This has been fixed, but you may need to click the &#8220;Sort&#8221; button to restack your old missiles.</li><li>Issues with missile blueprints not unlocking the the research is being looked in to. Please do not repurchase the blueprints if you encounter this issue.</li><li>AI units all given some unique aspects. Hunt them all!</li></ul>



<p>More releases incoming, including a planned &#8220;grand finale&#8221; event. We here at Battlehouse are eternally grateful to all our players, and we plan to go out with a bang on April 2023; and we would <strong>love</strong> it if you join us there!</p>

<p>This week in <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/daysofvalor?spin_campaign=7125_BH_post">Days of Valor</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Dear Commanders:</strong></p>



<p>It is with heavy hearts that after 10+ incredible years of producing Battlehouse games, we announce that Days of Valor will be taking its final ride off into the sunset in April 2023.</p>



<p>Effective now: We’re doubling the time speed-up for gold (halving the cost of all gold speed-ups), after which point we’ll be rolling out one final major content patch. While easing the grind on the next batch of content, we also plan to release a unique “End of The World” event that we think is going to be really fun for all of us. Days of Valor deserves to go out with a bang!</p>



<p>We can’t stress enough how appreciative we are of all of you, and everything you’ve all contributed to Battlehouse games over this time. The majority of free-to-play games don’t last nearly this long, and the fact that we thrived as long as we did is a direct credit to our passionate player base. We’re aware that many of you have been with us since the very beginning, helping to build and nurture this amazing global community that has enjoyed these games just as much as we have. For that, we say “Thank you!”</p>



<p>In advance of sun-setting the games, we want to be as transparent with everyone as we possibly can, give plenty of time to make sure our small team has a soft landing at their next adventures, and also so that we all properly celebrate the legacy of the games we all love.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that in-game purchases will be available up until March 31st, 2023, at which point the games’ payment systems will be completely turned off. Thereafter, the games will not be accepting any payments, but will remain open for one last hurrah until at least April 30th, 2023. Any remaining gold that you have during this period will need to be used before that date.</p>



<p>We hope that the experiences we’ve developed over the years have provided you with the highest level of entertainment that we’ve always strived to reach. This hasn’t been an easy decision for our team to make, but we remain hopeful that with every end, comes a new beginning.</p>



<p>Good hunting, Commanders!</p>

<p>New this week in <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/battlefrontmars?spin_campaign=7125_BH_post">Battlefront Mars</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Dear Martians:</strong></p>



<p>It is with heavy hearts that after 10+ incredible years of producing Battlehouse games, we announce that Battlefront Mars will be taking its final ride off into the sunset in April 2023.</p>



<p>Effective now: We’re doubling the time speed-up for gold (halving the cost of all gold speed-ups), after which point we’ll be rolling out one final major content patch. While easing the grind on the next batch of content, we also plan to release a unique “End of The World” event that we think is going to be really fun for all of us. Battlefront Mars deserves to go out with a bang!</p>



<p>We can’t stress enough how appreciative we are of all of you, and everything you’ve all contributed to Battlehouse games over this time. The majority of free-to-play games don’t last nearly this long, and the fact that we thrived as long as we did is a direct credit to our passionate player base. We’re aware that many of you have been with us since the very beginning, helping to build and nurture this amazing global community that has enjoyed these games just as much as we have. For that, we say “Thank you!”</p>



<p>In advance of sun-setting the games, we want to be as transparent with everyone as we possibly can, give plenty of time to make sure our small team has a soft landing at their next adventures, and also so that we all properly celebrate the legacy of the games we all love.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that in-game purchases will be available up until March 31st, 2023, at which point the games’ payment systems will be completely turned off. Thereafter, the games will not be accepting any payments, but will remain open for one last hurrah until at least April 30th, 2023. Any remaining gold that you have during this period will need to be used before that date.</p>



<p>We hope that the experiences we’ve developed over the years have provided you with the highest level of entertainment that we’ve always strived to reach. This hasn’t been an easy decision for our team to make, but we remain hopeful that with every end, comes a new beginning.<br>Godspeed, Martians!</p>
